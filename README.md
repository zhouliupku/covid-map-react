# covid-map-react
Code backup


Inspired by helping people in pandemic, designed, and developed a web application based on Google Map React, which allows users to check the real-time confirmed & death COVID cases in the U.S. on a responsive map displayed by counties, states, and nations with zoom feature.


Fetched the county-level data from JHUCSSE public database through AJAX sending through Axios. Implemented the functionalities to aggregate county cases into state and nation level based on zoom value.
